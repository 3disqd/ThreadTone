# ThreadTone | a halftone representation of an image made of thread

The process of generating an image with thread is an idea of [Petros Vrellis](http://artof01.com/vrellis/index.html). As I've documented [here](http://www.thevelop.nl/blog/2012-05-22/Thread-tone/) the process is comprised of three steps:
  
  * Image pre-processing (cropping, resizing, etc.)
  * Algorithm to place threads
  * In my case parsing the result to G-Code for automated fabrication

A set of two example images can be found below. Please refer to my blog for more details.

<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src='/assets/angelineThreaded.png' onmouseover="this.src='/assets/angelina.png';" onmouseout="this.src='/assets/angelineThreaded.png';" />

<img style="float: left;" src='/assets/poetinThreaded.png' onmouseover="this.src='/assets/poetin.png';" onmouseout="this.src='/assets/poetinThreaded.png';" />
